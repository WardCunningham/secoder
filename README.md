Secoder
=======

We simulate the dial pulse decoding logic of the electro-mechanical secoder, the device behind the
[dial-a-door](http://c2.com/~ward/Dial-a-Door/). This 1950 device was repurposed as a 1968 security device,
a hack that was recalled and further documented in 2008. See YouTube [video](http://youtu.be/xCc4F2ulBYc).
